# Bah, c'est une app flask quoi.

#### To make your project portable, you can export the list of installed packages:

## pip freeze > requirements.txt 

### Create a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
### Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

I install python on my Ubuntu system. However, when I try to run any python script returns an error. I found a solution on the internet that says I should create a virtual environment (venv). As a dyslexic person that have low latent inhibition, I want to understand what happens when I install python on my machine, how and why it works or doesn't, how do the venv work, and what are the best pratices. Please give me a detailed explanation with concrate examples.
